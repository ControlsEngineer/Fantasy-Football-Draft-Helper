# FFE-Draft-Aid

This drafting tool optimizes your lineup according to the players remaining on the draft board and the average value of replacement for each position.

This is a Work-in-Progress

Tips:

If you have any "Do-Not-Draft" players, enter them in the tool before the draft starts and it will remove them from the draft board

The tool does not take into account ADP, so if you like the suggested player but could get them at a later round, consider drafting a different player instead using the manual drafting window and waiting on the suggested player until a future round.
